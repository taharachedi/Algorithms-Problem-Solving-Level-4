# üóìÔ∏è Problem 54: Vacation Days Calculator 

> **A C++ program to calculate the number of business (non-weekend) days between two user-entered dates.**

## üìò Project Overview
This program allows users to input two dates representing the start and end of a vacation. It then calculates the number of actual vacation days, counting only business days and excluding weekends. The program handles leap years and varying month lengths, ensuring accurate date calculations.
